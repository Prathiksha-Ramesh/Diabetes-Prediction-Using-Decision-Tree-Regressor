# Diabetes Prediction Using Decision Tree Regressor

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting diabetes progression using a Decision Tree Regressor. The dataset used in this project is the well-known **Diabetes dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`, specifically loaded using the `load_diabetes()` function. The notebook includes sections on data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.

## Project Structure

- **notebook.ipynb**: Contains the code for data preprocessing, training the Decision Tree Regressor, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **data/**: (Optional) Directory where the dataset used for training and testing the model is stored.
- **models/**: (Optional) Directory to save trained models.
- **results/**: (Optional) Directory to save the results of the predictions and evaluation metrics.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored in the repository.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the Python packages required to run the project.
- **LICENSE**: Contains the licensing information for the project.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python packages, which can be installed using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pandas

You can install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Diabetes dataset provided by `scikit-learn`. This dataset contains 442 samples with 10 features each. It is commonly used to predict disease progression after one year, based on various baseline variables.

To load the dataset, the following code snippet is used in the notebook:

``` bash
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes

# Load the dataset
diabetes = load_diabetes()
X = diabetes.data
y = diabetes.target

```

## Usage

1. Data Preprocessing: The notebook begins by loading and preprocessing the dataset. Ensure your dataset is in the appropriate format, or modify the preprocessing steps accordingly.

2. Model Training: The Decision Tree Regressor is trained on the preprocessed data. You can tune parameters such as the depth of the tree, minimum samples per leaf, and others to improve model performance.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning: The notebook includes a section for hyperparameter tuning using grid search or other methods to find the best parameters for the Decision Tree Regressor.

4. Evaluation: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² score, etc. The results are then analyzed to ensure the model is performing as expected.

5. Predictions: Finally, the model is used to make predictions on new or unseen data, and the results are saved for further analysis.

## How to Run

To run the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the project steps.


## Future Work
- Explore additional algorithms for comparison.
- Implement feature selection to improve model accuracy.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters further for optimal performance.
